Important:
- Allow removing a Microclimate Connection (is this important, though, for local only?)
    - Related: persisting connection, in case it's not 9090
- Check server-side MC version, just like in Eclipse tools.
    - Instead do this in the restart code, if capabilities doesn't exist
- Node debug!!
- Tests!
- Bash into app container

Annoying Release Stuff:
- Legal!! No precendent for a VSCode extension, and we have to use the Microsoft store to distribute
- Icons
- externalize command names into package.nls.json (for ID)
- externalize all strings (ugh)
- better logging?
    - is there a logging facility provided for extensions

Less Important:

- WebView for opening app, Overview page
    - Discuss with Portal-UI creating an endpoint which sends a simple HTML page with NO <link rel>s with all the project info
        - Client (IDE) can request which stylesheet should be used for rendering (or provide the stylesheet itself).
        - Eclipse, VSCode dark, VSCode light, etc.

Investigate:
    - Problems view for Validation errors
    - Why do projects/connections sometimes get Emphasized?
