Important:
- Allow removing a Microclimate Connection (is this important, though, for local only?)
    - Related: persisting connection, in case it's not 9090
- Check server-side MC version, just like in Eclipse tools.
- Node debug!!

- Legal stuff! No precendent for a VSCode extension, and we have to use the Microsoft store to distribute

- externalize command names into package.nls.json (for ID)
- externalize all strings (ugh)

Less Important:
- Running tree-context commands quickly sometimes results in command being run with a null argument
    - Suspect because the tree item that was originally right-clicked gets disposed in the meantime, due to a state change etc.
- Refactor command resource-getting code out of project/connection commands

- WebView for opening app, Overview page
    - Have to write custom code to get <link>s -> and basically everything else a browser does!
    Alternatively:
    - IFrame seems to work well - But what are the implications of this for more complex frontends?
        - For Overview, works but requires gross cropping which would have to be updated if there are any css changes

Investigate:
    - Why do projects/connections sometimes get Emphasized? Cannot find any doc on this
        - Tried debugging vscode itself, but the emphasis never showed up in the debug instance >:(
        - Maybe it doesn't show up when it's an actual vsix and not running in extension debug mode??
