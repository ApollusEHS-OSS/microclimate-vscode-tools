Important:
- Tests!
- Consider 'docker logs' command (it should be provided by MC, not by me, tho)
- Give the user an easy way to clean up launch.json
- Add last build and last image build to Project Info page
- Force refresh command on connection context
- Node debug - Consider looking for 'nodemon crashed' message in app logs, and displaying a notification in this case
- Disabled projects should have validation errors removed
- Open Application Monitor

Annoying Release Stuff:
- Icons
- externalize all strings :(
- Legal?
- Copyrights

Less Important:

- WebView for Overview page
    - Discuss with Portal-UI creating an endpoint which sends a simple HTML page with NO <link rel>s with all the project info
        - Client (IDE) can request which stylesheet should be used for rendering (or provide the stylesheet itself).
        - Eclipse, VSCode dark, VSCode light, etc.
- Add .code-workspace file to project template and/or to microclimate-workspace
    - Recommend this extension

Investigate:
    - Why do projects/connections sometimes get Emphasized?
        - When their folders (treeItem.resourceUri) get emphasized from git changes, linting warnings, anything!
