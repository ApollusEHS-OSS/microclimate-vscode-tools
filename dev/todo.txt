Important:
- Hit the build log endpoint each time build logs are requested instead of just storing it once on project creation.
    - The build log location can change for Docker project types.
- 'Create default connection' as a separate command - where to display this? Palette/view bar/context when nothing selected
    - Can't test if no connections exist :(
- OK to require 18.11? Or:
    - Require 18.09 and test capabilities on restart
        - 1809 -> Liberty only
        - 1810 -> Liberty and Spring
    - Have to track startMode internally >:(
- Decide if appending stuff to the debug console is worth the possible confusion
    - Since it is only the most recently debugged project (if there are multiple, it's confusing beacuse you switch sessions but the console doesn't change)
    - Only clears if you restart the server into run mode
    - It's identical to the app output anyway. Rich text features are not used.
- Node debug!!
- Tests!

Annoying Release Stuff:
- better logging? needs to go to a file
    - is there a logging facility provided for extensions
- Icons
- externalize command names into package.nls.json (for ID)
- externalize all strings (ugh)
- Legal?
- Copyrights

Less Important:

- WebView for opening app, Overview page
    - Discuss with Portal-UI creating an endpoint which sends a simple HTML page with NO <link rel>s with all the project info
        - Client (IDE) can request which stylesheet should be used for rendering (or provide the stylesheet itself).
        - Eclipse, VSCode dark, VSCode light, etc.
- Add .code-workspace file to project template and/or to microclimate-workspace
    - Recommend this extension

Investigate:
    - Problems view for Validation errors
    - Why do projects/connections sometimes get Emphasized?
