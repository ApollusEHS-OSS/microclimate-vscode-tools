Important:
- Cancel debugger connection if java LSP fails to initialize - timeout appears to not work
- Node debug!!
- Tests!

Portal:
- ContainerID appears to not always get cleared when it should (on disable).
    - docker ps -a does not reveal a container with this ID or for this project, as it should. But Portal continues to provide a containerID.
    - This applies to the web UI too - containerID should be cleared when project is disabled.
- Portal should throw a client error if auto build is toggled for disabled project, since the request has no effect in this case.
    - [Thu Oct 25 2018 00:39:30:273 UTC] [ERROR] Project 19f42e10-d25b-11e8-a961-95635d57ea0e action enableautobuild failed, response code 500
    - This applies to the web UI too. Reproduce:
        - Disable project
        - Toggle auto build - Slider moves, as though it worked
        - Refresh the page - the slider returns to its former position, because the toggle didn't work.
    - This should be fixed in both portal and portal-ui. Portal should throw a 400 if the project is disabled.
    - Portal-ui should grey out this slider when the project is disabled.

Annoying Release Stuff:
- Icons
- externalize command names into package.nls.json (for ID)
- externalize all strings (ugh)
- Legal?
- Copyrights

Less Important:

- WebView for Overview page
    - Discuss with Portal-UI creating an endpoint which sends a simple HTML page with NO <link rel>s with all the project info
        - Client (IDE) can request which stylesheet should be used for rendering (or provide the stylesheet itself).
        - Eclipse, VSCode dark, VSCode light, etc.
- Add .code-workspace file to project template and/or to microclimate-workspace
    - Recommend this extension

Investigate:
    - Why do projects/connections sometimes get Emphasized?
        - When their folders (treeItem.resourceUri) get emphasized from git changes, linting warnings, anything!
