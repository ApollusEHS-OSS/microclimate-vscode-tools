Important:
- Allow removing a Microclimate Connection
- Stop context menu from showing up when the view (not a TreeItem) is right-clicked

Less Important:
- Toggle Enablement command (implemented as two separate commands which resolve to one command handler, like restart)
    - Done, but funky if you do quick requests on one project - maybe track 'in progress' requests
- Refactor command resource-getting code out of project/connection commands
- WebView for opening app, Overview page
