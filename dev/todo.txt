New:
- Attach Debugger command to Starting state
    - Works
    - New 'starting debug' state
    - Should have this in the other UIs
    - startMode is updated AFTER Starting state is reached, so it briefly shows the wrong startMode, but then it gets corrected when the restartResult is received
- Improvements to restart-debug behaviour
    - Extra delay for liberty
    - Preserve user edits of launch config, eg step filters, source location
- When Microclimate restarts when logs are open, the logs are reset properly
    - New log names - "Microclimate" is too long :| (debug name too)
    - Now displays a warning if you open app logs for Stopped app
        - but we still want to allow this for nodemon output - and probably should in the web UI too!
- Preference to show logs when updated
    - Separate prefs for build and app logs
    - Default behaviour: show build on change, but not app
    - Settings descriptions need work

Important:
- I need help testing
    - At what point do we pull in SVT?
- When is DCUT?
    - Can I do code sweep / cleanup after that, since it will likely be mostly comment changes?
        - Won't release these changes, will lock a release branch first)
- Better button labels when connection fails
- externalize strings
- Make start mode strings user friendly again

Annoying Release Stuff:
- Icons
- Copyrights
- Open Source-ability
    - Remove any internal issue links
    - Remove any references to other devs, teams
    - Add file headers and generally improve code documentation

Less Important:
- Show command that's running in promptForResource
- Expose log file location to user (but where?)
- Tests
    - Debug, restart tests are good
    - Would be great to get coverage for other commands - but for most of them, it's hard to test if the API calls worked
- WebView for Overview page
    - Discuss with Portal creating an endpoint which sends a simple HTML page with NO <link rel>s with all the project info
        - Client (IDE) can request which stylesheet should be used for rendering (or provide the stylesheet itself).
        - Eclipse, VSCode dark, VSCode light, etc.
- Add .code-workspace file to project template and/or to microclimate-workspace
    - Recommend this extension

Backlog:
    - Telemetry
        - https://www.npmjs.com/package/amplitude
        - Considerations for open-source
    - Why is there no linting for Node projects?
        - Theia does not support eslint.
            - Issue to add this support: https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-apps/issues/65
            - Can still run eslint in the terminal
        - To get eslint to run WITHIN vscode without the user having to take action, we have to add an eslintrc to our template project
        - eg https://github.ibm.com/timetchells/node-test/blob/master/.eslintrc.json
        - If we have this file in the WORKSPACE ROOT (ie, won't work if microclimate-workspace is the root), then eslint will work.
        - See ~/Documents/*linting.png
        - We should document this, at the very least.
        - ACTION:
            - Bring it up on planning-languages, adding least-restrictive-as-possible .eslintrc to node template
    - Colors
        - Super annoying to have ANSI color escapes in app output
            - Applies to Eclipse and manual 'docker logs' too
            - OTOH we are rendering the color in the web UI, so we can't just pass --no-color to nodemon
