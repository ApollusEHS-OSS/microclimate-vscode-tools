SVGs are preferred for all icons.

- Microclimate icon for the parent TreeItem
- "New" icon for New Connection toolbar button

- At least one icon for either each "language" or each "projectType".
    - Java (Microprofile, Spring could have different icons)
    - Node
    - Swift
    - Generic Docker (fall-through in case we don't have one for the specific language)
        - Python
        - Go
- One of each of the above icons, overlaid with a "Started" green triangle (possibly also "Starting")
- Again one of each, overlaid with "Stopped" red square (possible also "Stopping")
    - Starting, Stopping could alternatively have an icon showing the state is changing (ellipsis, or something?)
- Again one of each, overlaid with "Building" icon (not necessary for Node?)
- For Disabled, Stopped could be reused, or we could have a red X or similar
    - Could be reused for "Build Failed"
